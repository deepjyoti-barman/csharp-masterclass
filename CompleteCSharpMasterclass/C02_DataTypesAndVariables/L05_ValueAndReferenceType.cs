/*
NOTE:
- Data types can be categorized into two categories based on how they occupy memory location

- Value type: A data type which when declared and assigned a value, holds the value directly on its own memory space
- The value type uses a heap to store the value
- Value types data types are int, float, long, double, char, bool, decimal, double etc.

- Reference type: It data type which instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores the memory location of the actual data
- The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly
- Reference type data types are string, class, Array etc.
- When we copy this reference type of a data type it will just copy the memory address of the data so we will then have two variable pointing to the same data
